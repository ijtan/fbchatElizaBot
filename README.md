# Deprecation
This bot is no longer functional as the underlying facebook chat interface is no longer supported. 

# Facebook wrapper for [any bot] eliza bot
Remember that computer theraprist from 1966 (probably not)? It has been modernized !

Idk this was quite a fun project, I created a facebook wrapper for a bot, (credits to the original creator), then added a few fancy features such as:

- Send Images using the Google programmable console
- Blacklisting of Users
- Responding to messages if "eliza" is in the message, or someone replies to her messages (using the messenger reply) 
- Reacts to some obvious reactions (such as HAHA react when a message contains "hahaha" etc.) 
- Data collection (and further down the road spits out some statistics on the data collected)

Quite barebones and not meant to do anything special really.
